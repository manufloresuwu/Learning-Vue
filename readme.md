## INTRODUCTION
---
The objective of this program is showing my little steps in the JavaScript framework Vue.

## What Does The Program Do?
The program has a principal menu where you can see the two mini-projects that I made. The first one is a "Language Switcher" where you press the button and changes the greeting from english to spanish and viceversa and the second one is a "To Do List" where you can add and delete the tasks :D
