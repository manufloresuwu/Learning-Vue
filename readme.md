Learning the Vue Javascript Framework
---
The objective of this website is showing my little steps in the JavaScript framework Vue.

You can check out my Vue demonstrations [here](https://manufloresuwu.github.io/Learning-Vue/).

## What Does The Website Do?
The website has a  menu where you can see the two mini-projects that I made. The first one is a "Language Switcher" where you press the button and it changes the greeting from english to spanish and viceversa and the second one is a "To Do List" where you can add and delete tasks :D
